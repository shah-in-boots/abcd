At JBVA given symtpoms of pronounced LE weakness after diarrheal episode, concern for GBS and pt was transfered to UIC -Neuro ICU service.     FINDINGS : MRI L SPINE WWO: Alignment of lumbar spine and vertebral height are normally maintained with anatomical lordotic curvature. There are an 1 cm sized Schmorl's node in the inferior endplate of L4 that shows delayed contrast enhancement, and a focally increased contrast enhancement of the subchondral marrow posteriorly, likely representing vascularized granulation. The spinal canal is capacious. No evidence of nerve root impingement is seen at any visualized levels.   Intervertebral discs at the individual levels: T11-T12: Unremarkable. T12-L1: Unremarkable. L1-L2: Unremarkable. L2-L3: Mild disc bulge. L3-L4: Mild disc bulge. L4-L5: Disc space narrowing on the right side. Diffuse disc bulge eccentric to the right subarticular region with mild right neural foraminal stenosis. L5-S1: Mild facet hypertrophy on the right.  IMPRESSION: 1. No abnormal intraspinal contrast enhancement. 2. No evidence of herniated disc, spinal canal stenosis or nerve root impingement. 3. A large Schmorl's node at the inferior L4 and L4-L5 degenerative disc.

No signs of respiratory distress.  NIF: -50 and VC: 4 L. No autonomic instability. MRI L spine ordered to evaluate for any mechanical cause of weakness, dural enhancement or nerve root enhancement. CT L spine to evaluate for ossesous abnormalities. Final read still pending at time of discharge. On exam pt had regained strength in his LLE and was noted to have 1+  achilles reflexes bilaterally.  Able to ambulate wo difficulty. Unable to tandem, but states this is his baseline. Squats wo difficulty.  Overall clinical picture inconsistent with Gullian Barre. MRI wo structural lesions to explain sx; furthermore expect structural lesions to have static neurological findings.  Suspect pt had a viral myositis given recent infection  and elevated CK, which gradually improved.  Returned to baseline no indication for PT/OT. Okay to discharge home.  Should follow up w his PCP at the VA in 1 week. Continue outpt medication regimen, no changes made.  Advised to return to ED if symptoms return.

1,clinical_notes,3,337751,2017-02-27T16:35:11Z,,Physician,Discharge Summary,,"Neurocritical Care Attending Addendum I agree with the resident¿s note & plan. Patient's symptoms had been slowly improving from Wednesday-Sunday and on my intiial examination patient has normal motor strength with preserved ankle reflexes and chronic stocking-glove sensory loss. MRI L-spine negative. Labs reveal mild elevation in CK. Given recent viral prodrome and transient symptoms of muscle weakness and cramps the patient's diagnosis is most consistent with a viral myositis. I discussed options of observation in hospital x1-more day or discharge home with plan to return to ER if symptoms worsened and patient decided he wanted to go home. I have advised him to take 1-week off of work and we will provide documentation to miss work. The patient can follow up routinely with his PCP and he is encouraged to return to ER if his weakness returns. I personally saw the patient, reviewed all imaging, reviewed all medications, and all labs.   Baback Arshi, MD Neurocritical Care"

POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:  End-stage renal disease.  PROCEDURES:  Right axillary-axillary AV loop graft placement.  SURGEON:  Taylor D. Hicks, M.D.  RESIDENT:  Daniel Moreira, M.D.  ANESTHESIA:  General.  ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS:  20 mL.  SPECIMEN:  None.  COMPLICATIONS:  None.  INDICATIONS:  Ms. Vesey has a history of end-stage renal disease and was in need of permanent AV access.  She was therefore brought to the operating room for graft placement.  PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:  After informed consent was obtained, she was brought to the operating room, placed in supine position on the operating table.  IV antibiotics were administered and general anesthesia was induced.  The right arm was prepped and draped in usual sterile fashion.  A longitudinal incision was made over the medial proximal arm near the axilla.  Dissection was carried through the subcutaneous tissue down to the axillary vein.  It appeared of adequate size and quality to use as outflow for an AV graft.  It was dissected circumferentially, controlled with vessel.  We continued our dissection a little more deeply and identified the axillary artery.  It was dissected circumferentially for a length adequate to perform an anastomosis to control with a vessel loop.  I made a counterincision in the antecubital fossa and then created a subcutaneous tunnel between the incisions.  A 4-7 mm tapered PTFE graft was then pulled through the tunnel, taking care to ensure that no twisting took place during this process.  The patient was systemically heparinized.  After allowing sufficient time for the heparin to circulate, clamps were applied to the axillary artery.  Arteriotomy was made with a 15- blade and extended with Potts scissors.  The 4 mm end of the graft was spatulated and anastomosed to the artery in an end-to-side fashion with a running 6-0 Prolene suture.  Once this anastomosis was complete, the artery was flushed through the graft.  The clamp was then applied to the graft. Clamps were applied to the axillary vein.  A venotomy was made with an 11- blade and extended with Potts scissors.  The 7 mm end of the graft was spatulated, anastomosed the vein in end-to-side fashion with a running 6-0 Prolene suture.  Prior to completing the anastomosis, we allowed the vein to backbleed and flush the graft in 4 directions once again.  Once complete, the clamps were removed.  This resulted in excellent throw within the graft.  Once we achieved hemostasis, subcutaneous tissue was closed and both wounds with running 3-0 Vicryl sutures.  The skin was closed with 4-0 Monocryl sutures placed in subcuticular fashion.  Dermabond was applied to the wound. Anesthesia was reversed.  She was taken to recovery room in good condition. All needle, sponge, and instrument counts were reported to be correct at the end of the case.  I was present for the entire case.

She states that since the procedure she has noticed some numbness over her 4th and 5th digits in the right hand.  Additionally, she states that her grip strength has decreased.  She otherwise denies any complaints. Pt current receives HD via a LIJ tunneled permacath.  Pt is s/p fistulagram 3/6/19, with the findings described below:  ANGIOGRAPHIC FINDINGS:  The AV graft was patent from the arterial anastomosis through the venous anastomosis.  The axillary vein, subclavian vein, innominate vein, and superior vena cava were all widely patent without significant stenosis.  The innominate artery, right subclavian artery, and right axillary artery were all patent without significant stenosis.  The brachial artery distal to the anastomosis of the graft was patent, but was diminutive in size. Additionally, we observed reflux from the more distal artery back into the AV graft, consistent with steal syndrome.

POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:  Malfunctioning right arm arteriovenous graft with steal syndrome.  PROCEDURES:  Ligation of right arm arteriovenous graft with graft excision.  SURGEON:  Taylor D Hicks, MD.  RESIDENT:  Dr. Raven Jones.  ANESTHESIA:  Regional.  ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS:  10 mL.  SPECIMEN:  None.  COMPLICATIONS:  None.  INDICATION:  Ms. Vesey has a history of end-stage renal disease and had a right axillary-axillary AV loop graft placed for hemodialysis access.  She subsequently developed significant steal syndrome with motor weakness in her right hand.  An angiogram was performed that demonstrated no significant inflow stenosis.  Given her severe deficit, the decision was made to take her to the operating room for ligation of the graft in order to regain function in her right hand.  PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:  After informed consent was obtained, she was brought to the operating room and placed in the supine position upon the table.  Right upper extremity block was performed by the Anesthesia Service.  IV antibiotics were administered.  She was prepped and draped in usual sterile fashion.  Her axillary incision was reopened.  Dissection was carried through the subcutaneous tissue using electrocautery down to the arterial limb of the graft.  We traced the arterial limb of the graft down to the anastomosis to the axillary artery.  The graft was dissected circumferentially and controlled with a vessel loop.  We then turned our attention to the venous limb of the graft.  We identified the venous limb of the graft.  It was dissected circumferentially and traced down to its anastomosis to the axillary vein. The vein proximal and distal to the anastomosis was then dissected circumferentially.  A clamp was placed at the level of the arterial anastomosis.  A second clamp was placed on the graft.  The graft was then transected, leaving a small cuff of graft on the artery.  This cuff was oversewn with a 5-0 Prolene suture. Once complete, the clamp was removed.  Next, we applied clamps to the axillary vein.  The venous anastomosis was then taken down sharply using an 11 blade. The vein was repaired with a running 5-0 Prolene suture.  Once complete, the clamps were removed.  We then removed the remainder of the graft by pulling it through the tunnel.  It was delivered from the field.  We then checked the patient's radial pulse, which was now palpable once again.  Once we achieved hemostasis, the subcutaneous tissue was closed in multiple layers with 3-0 Vicryl sutures.  The skin was closed with a 3-0 nylon suture.  Sterile dressing was applied.  She was taken to Day Surgery in good condition.  All needle, sponge, and instrument counts were reported to be correct at the end of the case.  I was present for the entire case.

AFib 3.  CAD sp PCI  POSTPROCEDURE DIAGNOSES: 1.  Severe symptomatic aortic stenosis. 2.  Successful deployment of a 29 mm CoreValve Evolut Pro valve in the aortic position via right transfemoral access.  PROCEDURES PERFORMED: 1.  General Anesthesia by Anesthesiology. 2.  Bilateral iliofemoral angiography. 3.  Transvenous pacemaker insertion and removal. 4.  Left heart catheterization with simultaneous left ventricular and aortic pressures. 5.  Ascending aortography. 6.  Insertion and removal of an 16 F Cook sheath via the right femoral access with 2 Perclose sutures deployed in a preclose fashion. 7.  Successful deployment of a 29 mm CoreValve Evolut Pro valve in the aortic position. 8.  Balloon aortic valuloplasty with a 22 mm Z-Med balloon. 9.  Mynx vascular closure of the right femoral arteriotomy site.  INDICATIONS: Mrs Daizella Vesey is an extremely pleasant 80 yo woman with severe aortic stenosis who presented with dyspnea and heart failure and was found to have severe aortic stenosis. She was felt to be a high risk candidate for surgical aortic valve replacement and presented for TAVR.  DESCRIPTION OF THE PROCEDURE: After discussion of the risks, benefits, and alternatives, the patient signed informed consent.  The patient was brought to the hybrid operating suite in a stable, fasting and nonsedated state.  He was sterilely prepped and draped in the usual fashion and placed under conscious sedation by Anesthesiology.  1% lidocaine solution was used for local anesthesia and a 6-French pinnacle sheath was placed in the left femoral artery using a modified Seldinger technique. A 7-French pinnacle sheath was then placed in the left femoral vein using a modified Seldinger technique.  A left iliofemoral angiogram was performed in the LAO projection. Through the, femoral venous sheath, we advanced a transvenous pacer into the right ventricle and confirmed adequate pacing capture.  We then advanced a 5-French rim catheter with a Glidewire through the left femoral arterial sheath, and advanced it into the right external iliac artery.  A direct anterior puncture of the right femoral artery was performed using fluoroscopy and direct visualization with contrast injection through the rim catheter.  Two Perclose suture devices were deployed in a preclose fashion.  We serially dilated the arteriotomy site with a 12-French dilator followed by a 14-French then over the wire, advanced a 16-French Cook sheath.    We advanced a 6-French pigtail catheter through the left femoral arterial sheath into the ascending aorta and performed ascending aortography to confirm optimal deployment angles. Through the right femoral arterial sheath, we advanced an AL1 diagnostic catheter over a J wire and then exchanged for a straight wire, which we used to cross the aortic valve.  The AL1 diagnostic catheter was advanced into the left ventricle and the wire was exchanged for an exchange length J wire, which was advanced to the apex.  The AL1 was removed from the body, and an angled pigtail catheter was advanced over this wire into the left ventricle to obtain simultaneous left ventricular and aortic pressures.  A Confida wire was then advanced through the left ventricular pigtail catheter and we removed the pigtail catheter.  We then removed the Cook sheath and inserted the 29 mm CoreValve Evolut R valve using the in line sheath and passed it into the descending thoracic aorta.  The valve was advanced across the aortic arch across and then the aortic annulus.  We successfully deployed the 29 mm CoreValve Evolut Pro valve.    The valve delivery system was then removed followed by reinsertion of the Cook sheath and passage of the pigtail catheter into the left ventricle. Simultaneous left ventricular and aortic pressures showed no residual gradient, however, there was some aortic insufficiency, and thus a 22mm Z-Med balloon was used for post dilation. Final ascending aortography showed no significant aortic insufficiency.  The pigtail catheter was then removed, followed by removal of the Cook sheath, with deployment of the Perclose suture devices.  The left femoral arteriotomy was then closed using a Mnyx device.  Protamine was administered to reverse the ACT and the temp wire was removed.  The procedure was tolerated well without complications and heparin was used for anticoagulation during the case and verified with ACT measurements.  DISCUSSION: Mrs Daizella Vesey is an extremely pleasant 80 yo woman with severe aortic stenosis who presented with dyspnea and heart failure and was found to have severe aortic stenosis. She was felt to be a high risk candidate for surgical aortic valve replacement and presented for TAVR. Successful right transfemoral TAVR was performed today with implantation of a 29 mm CoreValve Evolut Pro valve.  The patient was transferred for the ICU for post-procedure care.  PLAN: 1.  We will complete access site precautions and monitor in the Intensive Care Unit. 2.  Restart Eliquis in the AM on POD#1. 3.  Monitor on telemetry and consider permanent pacemaker device implantation depending on conduction system disease observed overnight. 4.  Plan for transthoracic echocardiography to evaluate the aortic valve tomorrow. 5.  He should follow up with Dr. Groves  within 4 weeks with outpatient TTE.  Thank you for allowing us to participate in the care of your patient. If you have any further questions, please do not hesitate to contact us."

General Anesthesia by Anesthesiology. 2.  Bilateral iliofemoral angiography. 3.  Transvenous pacemaker insertion and removal. 4.  Left heart catheterization with simultaneous left ventricular and aortic pressures. 5.  Ascending aortography. 6.  Insertion and removal of an 16 F Cook sheath via the right femoral access with 2 Perclose sutures deployed in a preclose fashion. 7.

Mynx vascular closure of the right femoral arteriotomy site.  TTE 5/25/2018 CONCLUSIONS:  1. Due to technical issues, the quality of the study was limited.  2. Normal left ventricular function.  3. LV ejection fraction is visually estimated to be 65 to 70%.  4. Moderate concentric left ventricular hypertrophy.  5. A bioprosthetic valve (TAVR) is present in the aortic position. It is not Well seen. Suggestion of mild insufficiency but origin (perivalvular vs transvalvular is difficult to determine.) V max 1.5 m/sec. DI 0.8.  6. A late peaking velocity is noted in the LVOT Vmax 3.06 m/sec which would be c/w dynamic LVOT obstruction with a peak gradient of approx 37 mm hg.  7. PA systolic pressure not assessed due to an inadequate degree of tricuspid insufficiency.  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Ms. Vesey is an 80 y/o female with PMHx hypotension on midodrine, CAD s/p PCI with multiple DES to LAD/LCx, mod-severe AS, COPD/asthma on 2-3L home O2, ESRD on HD T Th S, Afib on eliquis, gout presents from nursing home for scheduled TAVR on 5/24/18. Patient originally presented to ED on 2/13/18 for evaluation of her left arm fistula not working. Patient had been referred to UIC from St. Anthony's to have cath procedure done as outpatient, however given the failure of her fistula she was told to come to UIC on 2/13 to obtain pre-op clearance prior to having new access placement. The patient was admitted and underwent LHC on 2/14/18 which showed multi-vessel disease along with moderate-severe aortic stenosis. CT Surgery was consulted for evaluation for CABG. Work up for CABG was initiated; however given the patient's age, and co-morbidities, she elected to undergo staged PCI instead. A temporary dialysis catheter was placed by IR for HD access. She subsequently underwent successful PCI of the distal left main and LAD on 2/19/18 with potential for further PCI and possible aortic valve repair. She was restarted on warfarin for her Afib and on ticagrelor (ticagrelor chosen because of unfavorable clopidogrel genomics) for 6months with plans to transition from ticagrelor to ASA 81 afterwards. Patient was discharged to nursing home for rehab where she has remained stable. Per patient, she was switched from warfarin to eliquis ~1 month ago due to difficulty controlling INR (supratherapeutic). She elected to have scheduled TAVR on 5/24/18 to address her aortic stenosis--mean AV gradient of 25.9 mmHg, peak AV velocity of 3.25 m/s and valve area of 1.16 cm¿.

I discussed the management with the residents and  Cardiology Fellow.  I agree with the documented findings and plan of care with corrections noted below about TTE findings:  Pt doing well s/p TAVR on 5/24/2018; no post-procedural issues except for some N/V this AM.   TTE from 5/25/2018 reviewed shows normal functioning TAVR with perhaps mild-mod PVL though not well seen; there is a late peaking mid-cavitary LV gradient that is due to a hyperdynamic LV with end-cavity obliteration and not a dynamic LVOT velocity (no SAM seen). No dynamic murmur heard on exam on AM of discharge.  Pt to follow up in Valve clinic for follow up.    M. Kansal Cardiology Attending

I reviewed the echo and angiogram findings myself please obtain carotid ultrasound and GSV vein mapping ultrasound as well as PFTs to assess the lung functions and breathing capacity . if the workup is completed and the patien is agreable I would recommend CABG and aortic valve assessment for possible AVR early next week.

Pt was initially supposed to be referred to UIC for cardiac workup prior to undergoing new fistula placement, but given her fistula stopped working at HD session on 2/13, she was instructed to come through our ED.  She was admitted to Cardiology after having elevated troponins (0.09) in the ED.  TTE was obtained on 2/14 showing LVEF 55-60% with moderate aortic stenosis (mean gradient 25.9mmHg, Vmax 3.25 m/s, and valve area of 1.16cm2. She was then sent for LHC which was completed on same day 2/14, which demonstrated multi vessel disease-->70% distal L main lesion, LAD with 60% mid stenosis, and LCx with ostial 60% lesion.  Given L main disease and moderate aortic stenosis, CT Surgery was consulted for CABG and AVR evaluation.

Daniel Feldman, MD 2.  Mohammed Al-Yafi, MD  PREPROCEDURE DIAGNOSIS: 1.  Coronary artery disease 2.  Severe distal left main disease 3.  Severe proximal to mid LAD disease  POST PROCEDURE DIAGNOSIS: 1.  Successful PCI to the distal left main bifurcation 2.  Successful PCI to the proximal LAD 3.  Successful PCI to the mid LAD  PROCEDURES PERFORMED:   1.  Selective coronary angiography  2.  Intravascular ultrasound interrogation of the left main, LAD and LCx 3.  Successful PCI to the distal left main bifurcation using a culotte technique with a 3.5x26mm Resolute Onyx stent into the LCx and a 3.5x22mm Resolute Onyx into the LAD post dilated with a 4.5mm NC in the left main 4.  Successful PCI to the proximal LAD with a 3.5x34mm Resolute Onyx 5.  Successful PCI to the mid LAD with a 3x18mm Resolute Onyx 6.  Ileofemoral angiography  CLINICAL HISTORY:  Mrs Diazella Vesey is a very pleasant 80yo woman with multivessel CAD, COPD, AS, ESRD and AFib who presented with unstable angina. She was found to have distal left main coronary artery disease and moderate to severe AS. Her STS score was 17-18% risk of mortality with an open procedure, thus she elected a percutaneous approach.  PREMEDICATIONS:  Benadryl 50 mg PO on call, Valium 5 mg PO on call  CONSCIOUS SEDATION:  Versed 1mg and Fentanyl 25mcg were given under the direction of the primary operator in conjunction with the nurse in the case monitoring the patient. Doses were titrated to effect to achieve adequate levels of moderate sedation. A total of 90 minutes of monitoring were required.  APPROACH:  The procedure was performed via left femoral artery access.  COMPLICATIONS:  None.  Patient tolerated the procedure well.  No access site hematoma was present and distal pulses were intact.  The patient left the Catheterization Lab in stable condition.  HEMODYNAMIC DATA:  Aortic pressure (mmHg):  128/50  PROCEDURAL MEDICATIONS     Total units Heparin given:  18000     Intracoronary NTG:  200  Other:  None  VESSEL DILATED:  Mid LAD SUPPLIES UTILIZED:       Guiding Catheter:  7F XB 3.5     Guide Wire:  Sion Blue     Balloon Dilatation Catheter:  None     Stent:  3x18mm Resolute Onyx PROCEDURAL COMMENTS:  After access was obtained a ileofemoral angiogram demonstrated no bleeding and a CFA puncture. A 7F XB 3.5 guide was engaged in the LM. Sion blue wires were passed into the distal LAD and distal LCx. IVUS images were obtained which demonstrated a 4.5mm proximal LAD, distal LM MLA of <6mm2 and ostial LCx and LAD disease. Mid LAD is then directly stented with a 3x18mm Resolute Onyx.  VESSEL DILATED:  Proximal LAD SUPPLIES UTILIZED:       Guiding Catheter:  7F XB 3.5     Guide Wire:  Sion Blue     Balloon Dilatation Catheter:  3x20mm NC Euphora     Stent:  3.5x34mm Resolute Onyx PROCEDURAL COMMENTS:  A 3x20mm NC Euphora was then used to predilate the proximal LAD and the vessel was stented with a 3.5x34mm Resolute Onyx.  VESSEL DILATED:  Distal left main into LCx and LAD SUPPLIES UTILIZED:       Guiding Catheter:  7F XB 3.5     Guide Wire:  Sion Blue     Balloon Dilatation Catheter:  4.5x12mm NC Euphora, 3.5x15mm NC Euphora x2     Stent:  Culotte technique with a 3.5x26mm Resolute Onyx stent into the LCx and a 3.5x22mm Resolute Onyx into the LAD PROCEDURAL COMMENTS:  Attention was turned to the LM bifurcation. A 3.5x26mm Resolute Onyx was placed from the LM into the proximal LCx. The LM portion of the stent was then treated with a 4.5x12mm NC Euphora for proximal optimization (POT). The wire in the LCx was passed into the LAD the stent struts were opened with a 3x30mm NC Euphora and a 3.5x22mm Resolute Onyx was placed from the LM into the LAD. Re-POT was then performed. Kissing inflation was then completed with two 3.5x15mm NC Euphora balloons. All wires were then removed. After infusion of intracoronary nitroglycerin, final angiography demonstrated TIMI 3 flow, no dissections, no perforations and 0% residual stenosis.  MANUAL HOLD/CLOSURE DEVICE/SHEATHS IN PLACE:  Perclose  CONCLUSIONS: 1.  Successful PCI to the distal left main bifurcation 2.  Successful PCI to the proximal LAD 3.  Successful PCI to the mid LAD  RECOMMENDATIONS: 1.  Clopidogrel 75mg and Warfarin with a goal INR of 2-3 for 6 months then replace Clopidogrel with ASA 81mg and continue Warfarin 2.

Based on clinical and genetic factors, it is unclear if this patient is likely to be responsive to clopidogrel at standard doses.   a. Genotype shows likely intermediate CYP2C19 metabolism. CYP2C19 plays a major role in the metabolism of clopidogrel to its active metabolite.  The CYP2C19 *1/*2 genotype may be associated with reduced platelet inhibition, increased residual platelet aggregation, and increased risk for adverse cardiovascular events with clopidogrel. b. Prasugrel or ticagrelor can be considered if no contraindications exist (moderate CPIC recommendation strength).  c. Will proceed w/ Accumetrics for phenotyping. D/w Dr Groves, pref continuing w/ clopidogrel due to concurrent warfarin. Will switch to alternate antiplatelet if phenotype necessitates.    2. Using genetics to guide antiplatelet therapy may result in more effective prevention of adverse cardiovascular events.  a. JACC Cardiovasc Interv. 2018;11(2):181-91. b. NEJM 2009;360:354-62.  c. JAMA 2009;302:849-57.   3. However, controlled clinical trials have yet to be published showing that genotype-guided antiplatelet therapy prevents cardiovascular outcomes.   a. Current consensus guidelines state that the evidence base is currently insufficient to recommend routine genetic testing in all patients undergoing PCI.  But, it also states that there may be a potential role in patients undergoing high-risk PCI procedures such as unprotected left main, bifurcating left main, or last patent coronary artery (JACC 2011;58:e44-122). b.
